## Overview 
 When working at one job, I was needed to render ALL emails that we were sending to users and
give these emails to our support, so they can make the text and design better. 
 I had a **really** hard time with this assignment. There were simply no easy'n fast solution on the web,
so I've decided to find one node library to solve this problem. 
 This repo is the result of that implementation.
